# üîé Seekly

Seekly is a lightweight web application that allows users to search for **movies** and **images** using external APIs.

- Movies are retrieved from [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://developer.themoviedb.org/).
- Images are retrieved from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/).

The app displays search results in a responsive grid of cards, provides user-friendly error handling with toast notifications, and includes a feedback form for further improvements.

## üé® UX

The goal of **Seekly** was to create a simple, intuitive, and responsive application for quick searches of movies and images.

**Key considerations:**

- Clear and minimalistic layout
- Prominent search form with radio buttons for category selection (Movies / Images)
- Responsive design, ensuring usability on desktop and mobile
- User feedback through toast notifications
- Default placeholder image for missing posters

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details

### üîó Axios Integration

The project uses the **Axios** library (installed via npm) to handle HTTP requests.  
Axios was chosen because it offers:

- a convenient promise-based syntax,
- automatic JSON response parsing,
- built-in support for query parameters,
- better error handling compared to the native `fetch()`.

In this project, Axios is mainly applied to integrate with the **Pixabay API** in order to retrieve image data based on the user‚Äôs search query.

---

### üñºÔ∏è Event Delegation for Gallery Clicks

The project uses **event delegation** for handling user interactions with the gallery:

- instead of attaching event listeners to every image, a single listener is set on the parent element (`ul.gallery`),
- this makes the application more efficient, especially since new images are dynamically loaded after each search,
- when an image is clicked, the user can access the link to its high-resolution version.

---

### üí° basicLightbox Modal

To display images in a larger format, the project integrates the **basicLightbox** library.  
Key benefits of using basicLightbox:

- a lightweight, dependency-free modal window solution,
- easy to integrate and customize,
- provides a clean way to preview content in full size.

The library was installed via **npm**, but it is also available through **CDN**.  
In this project, it is used to open and display high-resolution images when users click on thumbnails in the gallery.

---

### üîî iziToast Notifications

The project implements **iziToast** to provide user-friendly notifications.  
It is used for:

- showing error messages (e.g., when the search field is empty),
- warning users when no results are found,
- confirming actions such as feedback submission.

iziToast was added via **npm**, but is also available for use with CDN.  
Its main advantage is the non-intrusive, modern notification design, which improves user experience.

### üé• TMDB API for Movie Search

For video search, the project integrates with **The Movie Database (TMDB) API**.

Important notes for usage:

- registration is required to obtain a personal **API key**,
- API requests must be authenticated,
- the [Image Basics guide](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/image-basics) explains how to retrieve and display posters,
- the [Search Movies reference](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/search-movie) provides details for implementation (‚ö†Ô∏è make sure to choose **JavaScript** from the available code samples).

---

### üì∑ Pixabay API for Image Search

For image search functionality, the project uses the **Pixabay API**.

Important notes for usage:

- registration is required to obtain a personal **API key**,
- Axios is used to manage requests and responses from the API.

---

### ‚è≥ Loader (Preloader)

The project includes a **loader animation** to improve the user experience while search results are being fetched from the APIs.

- It is displayed in place of results during the waiting time,
- It disappears once the search data (images or movies) has been successfully loaded,
- This ensures that users clearly understand the application is working in the background and haven‚Äôt encountered an error.

The loader is implemented using **pure CSS**, adapted from the [W3Schools Loader Example](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_loader2).
