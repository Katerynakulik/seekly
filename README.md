# üîé Seekly

Seekly is a lightweight web application that allows users to search for **movies** and **images** using external APIs.

- Movies are retrieved from [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://developer.themoviedb.org/).
- Images are retrieved from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/).

The app displays search results in a responsive grid of cards, provides user-friendly error handling with toast notifications, and includes a feedback form for further improvements.

## ‚ú® Functionality

The application provides the following core features:

- **Movie Search (TheMovieDB API)**  
  Users can search for movies by entering a keyword. The app sends requests to [TheMovieDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/) and displays the results as interactive movie cards with titles and posters.

- **Image Search (Pixabay API)**  
  Users can search for high-quality images via the [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/). Results are shown in a responsive gallery with preview thumbnails and access to larger versions of the images.

- **Card-Based Results Display**  
  Search results for both movies and images are presented as cards. Each card highlights relevant details such as a movie‚Äôs title and poster, or an image thumbnail with additional metadata (likes, views, downloads).

- **Error Handling with Notifications (iziToast)**  
  If a search query fails or no results are found, the app displays clear and user-friendly notifications using the [iziToast](https://izitoast.marcelodolce.com/) library.

- **Loading Indicator (Loader)**  
  While data is being fetched from external APIs, a loader animation is displayed to indicate that the request is in progress. This enhances user experience by making the waiting time visible.

- **Feedback Form**  
  At the bottom of the page, users can submit feedback through a simple form. The form allows users to share missing keywords or suggest categories. Upon submission, users receive a confirmation message.

There are warnings mostly about vendor prefixes (like -webkit-, -moz-, -ms-, -o-) and unrecognized at-rules. These are non-standard properties used to ensure compatibility with older versions of specific browsers, but they are considered outdated by the validator.

### üîç 7. JavaScript

All JavaScript files were tested with [JSHint](https://jshint.com/).  
The project uses **modern JavaScript (ES6‚ÄìES11)**, so some warnings (e.g., `import.meta`, `optional chaining`) are expected.  
They are not runtime errors, since the project is bundled with **Vite** and runs in modern browsers.

## üîé Search Implementation

The search functionality in the application is designed to provide results from two different sources, depending on the category selected by the user:

- **Movie Search (TheMovieDB API)**  
  When the user selects the **Movies** category, the application sends a request to [TheMovieDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/search-movie).  
  The API returns a list of movies matching the search keyword. Each result includes details such as the movie title and a poster image, which are displayed as interactive cards on the results page.

- **Image Search (Pixabay API)**  
  When the user selects the **Images** category, the application communicates with the [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/).  
  The API returns a collection of high-quality images related to the search term. Each image is presented in the gallery view with metadata (likes, views, downloads), and users can access larger versions via the integrated lightbox.

Both searches share a common workflow:

1. The user submits a keyword through the search form.
2. The application determines the selected category (Movies or Images).
3. Based on the category, the appropriate API request is made.
4. Results are displayed in a visually structured gallery.
5. If no results are found, a user-friendly notification is shown.

## üöÄ Deployment

### Why Vite?

The project was initially bootstrapped with **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** instead of older bundlers such as Webpack or Create React App.

- ‚ö° **Fast development**: Vite provides lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR), which makes the development process much smoother.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Modern setup**: Out-of-the-box support for ES modules, optimized builds, and a simple project structure.
- üì¶ **Optimized production builds**: Vite bundles the application with Rollup, producing small and efficient assets.

### Why Vercel?

The application is hosted on **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**, a platform optimized for frontend frameworks and static site deployments.

- üåç **Free hosting with global CDN**: Ensures fast performance worldwide.
- üîÑ **Automatic deployment**: Each push to the main branch redeploys the app automatically.
- üß© **Perfect integration with Vite**: Vercel handles static assets and ES modules without extra configuration.

### Initial Setup

The project was created using the following steps:

1. **Initialize Vite project**

   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest seekly
   cd seekly
   npm install
   ```

2. Install dependencies (axios, iziToast, basicLightbox, etc.)

   ```bash
   npm install axios izitoast basiclightbox
   ```

3. Add custom code: JS-files, CSS, services, and API integrations were implemented inside the /src folder.

### Environment Variables

The app requires access to third-party APIs:

- [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) (for image search)
- [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) (for movie/video search)

To use these services, you must:

1. **Register** on the [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/accounts/register/) and [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup) websites.
2. **Obtain personal API tokens** from your account dashboards.
3. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory of your local project with the following variables:

VITE_PIXABAY_API_KEY=your_pixabay_api_key
VITE_TMDB_TOKEN=your_tmdb_api_key

4. **Add `.env` to `.gitignore`** to prevent committing sensitive data to version control.
5. When deploying to **Vercel**, add these environment variables under _Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables_.

### Running Locally

To run the project on your own machine:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Katerynakulik/seekly.git

# Navigate into the project folder
cd seekly

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file and add your personal API tokens as described above.

# Start local development server
npm run dev

```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).

### Deploying on Vercel

1. Push your repository to GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket).
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and create a new project.
3. Import your repository, select the Vite preset, and deploy.
4. Add environment variables in the project settings.
5. The live link will be generated automatically (e.g., https://seekly.vercel.app/).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details

### üîó Axios Integration

The project uses the **Axios** library (installed via npm) to handle HTTP requests.
Axios was chosen because it offers:

- a convenient promise-based syntax,
- automatic JSON response parsing,
- built-in support for query parameters,
- better error handling compared to the native `fetch()`.

In this project, Axios is mainly applied to integrate with the **Pixabay API** in order to retrieve image data based on the user‚Äôs search query.

---

### üñºÔ∏è Event Delegation for Gallery Clicks

The project uses **event delegation** for handling user interactions with the gallery:

- instead of attaching event listeners to every image, a single listener is set on the parent element (`ul.gallery`),
- this makes the application more efficient, especially since new images are dynamically loaded after each search,
- when an image is clicked, the user can access the link to its high-resolution version.

---

### üí° basicLightbox Modal

To display images in a larger format, the project integrates the **basicLightbox** library.
Key benefits of using basicLightbox:

- a lightweight, dependency-free modal window solution,
- easy to integrate and customize,
- provides a clean way to preview content in full size.

The library was installed via **npm**, but it is also available through **CDN**.
In this project, it is used to open and display high-resolution images when users click on thumbnails in the gallery.

---

### üîî iziToast Notifications

The project implements **iziToast** to provide user-friendly notifications.
It is used for:

- showing error messages (e.g., when the search field is empty),
- warning users when no results are found,
- confirming actions such as feedback submission.

iziToast was added via **npm**, but is also available for use with CDN.
Its main advantage is the non-intrusive, modern notification design, which improves user experience.

---

### üé• TMDB API for Movie Search

For video search, the project integrates with **The Movie Database (TMDB) API**.

Important notes for usage:

- registration is required to obtain a personal **API key**,
- API requests must be authenticated,
- the [Image Basics guide](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/image-basics) explains how to retrieve and display posters,
- the [Search Movies reference](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/search-movie) provides details for implementation (‚ö†Ô∏è make sure to choose **JavaScript** from the available code samples).

---

### üì∑ Pixabay API for Image Search

For image search functionality, the project uses the **Pixabay API**.

Important notes for usage:

- registration is required to obtain a personal **API key**,
- Axios is used to manage requests and responses from the API.

---

### ‚è≥ Loader (Preloader)

The project includes a **loader animation** to improve the user experience while search results are being fetched from the APIs.

- It is displayed in place of results during the waiting time,
- It disappears once the search data (images or movies) has been successfully loaded,
- This ensures that users clearly understand the application is working in the background and haven‚Äôt encountered an error.

The loader is implemented using **pure CSS**, adapted from the [W3Schools Loader Example](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_loader2).
